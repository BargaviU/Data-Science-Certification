    "Ans:\n",
    "== is equal to operator that compares two values and results in a Boolean, whereas = is an assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.\n",

    "Ans: Block refers to group of statement in the program.\n",
    "To indicate a block, we have to indent the statements to the same amount.\n",
