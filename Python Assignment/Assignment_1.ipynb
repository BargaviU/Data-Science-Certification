    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\n",
    "6 \n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Values: 'hello', -87.8, 6\n",
    "Expression: *,-,/,+\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Variable is used to assign values or data and store the information. String is a type of variable which contains any character or sequence of characters. Usualy it is enclosed within '' or \" \".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "integer - int data type is used to store numbers. (eg:456)\n",
    "string - String will store characters or sequence of characters enclosed withing '' or \"\". eg: \"I am Bargavi. I am a student of ineuron\"\n",
    "Boolean - Boolean is used to represent True or False. It will be used in confirming if a statement is true or false. eg: 1 == 0 will be False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Expressions are combination of values, operators, variabes or functions that always returns a result.\n",
    "eg: 10+5-3\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An expression will be evaluated by the interpreter and returns a value.\n",
    "A statement is a piece of code that performs some action. It need not return a value\n",
    "eg: x=10 (statement)\n",
    "y=10\n",
    "x+y(expression)\n",
    "print(x) (statement)\n",
    "Note: Expression is also a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Bacon will return 22. As it is not assigned wih bacon+1, the initial assignment will remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Both will return 'spamspamspam'. 'spam'+ 'spamspam' is String Concatenation whereas 'spam'*3 is String Multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Variable name cannot be number. It will result in Syntax Error, cannot assign to literal. There are set of predefined rules to define a variable. One of the rule is variable name cannot be a number or start with number. However, variable name will number after a character or _ will be considered (eg:_100 = 10, A100 = 10) but is not a standard practice to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Integer - int()\n",
    "String - str()\n",
    "Float - float()\n",
    "will evaluate the corresponding versions of the value.\n",
    "eg: int(5.5) (results in 5)\n",
    "float(5) (results in 5.0)\n",
    "str(5) (results in '5')\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "It will return in TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "Integers cannot be concatenated with a string.\n",
    "Either it has to enclosed in '' or typecasted to a string.\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'"
